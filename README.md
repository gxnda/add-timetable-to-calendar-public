# G4S_API_UI

Currently, this only works for students!!! - I also have no intention to add any other user types, because I'm not a teacher/admin etc.

Requirements:
- The user must log in with their Go4Schools Login, I haven't added options for Microsoft etc. yet.
- If the packages are not installed, pip must be installed and on %PATH%. If it isn't on path, you will have to do 
- some tinkering to the "install()" function to get it to work.



Bugs:
- None known at the moment.
